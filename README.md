- In case if a local performer is absent the global one is used, e.g.

- Performer and title track separators:
  - `' - '` — 45 (hyphen-minus)
  - `' – '` — 8211 (en dash)
  - `' ‒ '` — 8210 (figure dash)
  - `' — '` — 8212 (em dash)
  - `' ― '` — 8213 (horizontal bar)
- Timings recognition:
  - `[08:45] 03. 8 Ball` → `08:45`
  - `01.[18:02] Giuseppe` → `18:02`
  - `10:57 02. Space Manoeuvres` → `10:57`
  - `56:53 T.O.M'` → `56:53`
  - `1:02:28 Mossy` → `62:28`

## Regions list recognition

- Sony Sound Forge format `dd:dd:dd[.,]dd`
- Adobe Audition format `dd:dd:dd:dd`
- Audacity format `ddddd.dddddd`

# For developers

## How to deploy

GitHub Actions provide 2 workflows which deploy code to the Firebase Hosting

- on a pull request the branch in question is deployed to a temporary channel for a preview
- on push to the `main` branch if commit contains "(release):" string the code is deployed to the live channel

## How to release

A new release happens when a new commit prefixed with *fix* or *feat* is merged to the `main` branch. The logic is described in the `firebase-hosting-merge.yml` file.
